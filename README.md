Reducing the memory consumption of data (involving dataframes) can prove to be beneficial in many ways:

1.reduces loading time

2.faster run time

3.quicker predictions

4.useful when running ML algorithms on memory limited systems

5.and especially useful when running kernels on Kaggle


# reduce_memory_dataframe
